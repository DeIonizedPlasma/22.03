# Week 3

<div></div>

## Project decision

<div></div>

We finally settled on the goal of making a device which takes in and stores energy to cook food. The decision was made after eliminating many of the other ideas on the table. We threw out the bike/transportation idea because we could not conceive of a project which would be more complex/interesting than solar/batteries. Many of the ideas such as rainwater/stairway energy usage were deemed too low-power or too removed from a conceivable usecase to be practical. This left us with solar, and some function which would be hopefully applicable to as many people as possible. The most popular idea was to cook food, as this could be done in public and has a clear, tangible result (a hot meal). 


## Initial work

<div></div>

We started by looking for prior work into solar cookers (preferably ones that were not just a solar panel connected to batteries/heating elements). I found <a href="https://solarcooking.fandom.com/wiki/Sun_Buckets">Sun Buckets</a>, a (potentially now inactive) company which used parabolic dishes to heat a phase change reservoir that could be used to cook food while maintaining a relatively uniform temperature.


## Team breakdown

The class was split into 3 groups for energy collection, energy storage/distribution, and energy usage. I am in the energy collection group so I expect to be looking at the design and manufacture of suitable parabolic light receivers (we are not interested in solar panels) and perhaps the collection of focused light to energy storage.
