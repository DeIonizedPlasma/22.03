# Week 4

## Overview

<div></div>

We started the week working in our teams and exploring the broad scope of potential solutions to each sub-problem. The energy capture team broke down our methods into two main categories of reflectors and lenses. In both cases, we identified the favorable heat transfer in a system with as uniform a heat deposition rate as possible onto the heat reservoir. For lenses this would require a nonuniform surface as making custom lenses is outside the scope of the class, but for reflectors we can easily change the shape of the mirror or the absorption surface.
