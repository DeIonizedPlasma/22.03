# Week 4

## Overview

<div></div>

We started the week working in our teams and exploring the broad scope of potential solutions to each sub-problem. The energy capture team broke down our methods into two main categories of reflectors and lenses. In both cases, we identified the favorable heat transfer in a system with as uniform a heat deposition rate as possible onto the heat reservoir. For lenses this would require a nonuniform surface as making custom lenses is outside the scope of the class, but for reflectors we can easily change the shape of the mirror or the absorption surface.


Most of my analysis was focused on reflector-based methods, so I looked at this problem of reflector shape, receiver shape, and areal power density on the collector. I got about half the way and made models for the 2d/parabolic trough case, as well as the 3d/parabolic dish case. The trough analysis was done in desmos and can be found <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/e9mzko4wk1">here</a>. The 3D case requires mathematica to run, but the source code is shown <a href="./Solarcooker.nb">here</a>.

Shown below is a demonstration of why reflector shape influences power density on the receiver:
