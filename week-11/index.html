# Week 11

## Overview

<div></div>

This week I attempted to complete the first test assembly of the reflector with all 4 rings. I fixed each in place with hot glue, and took a timelapse of the construction shown below.

The assembly seemed to focus light fairly well, but the support structure was ultimately too flexible and the hot glue too weak a bond for this to be a useable prototype attached to the final assembly. I also needed to add the central hole, so the reflectors were removed and a hexagonal hole was cut in the center for light to pass through the dish. To make the reflector less flexible and provide mounting points to the final assembly, I attached wooden supports to the back of the plate.

I also designed and printed parts for the secondary reflector this week, making a 4 inch outer diameter parabolic reflector with a focal length of 2 inches. The reflector started as a parabolic profile, and was extruded into a flat parabolic sheet:

The sheet was patterned 12 times in a circle, with the intersections between each parabolic sheet used to provide a cut angle. This approximated a three-dimensional parabola with surfaces of curvature along a single axis, allowing for mylar to be laid on each segment without the need for stretching. Legs were extended downwards, and a 0.5mm tolerance was added for the eventual 3D print. A 2D profile was drafted for the mylar by flattening the surface of the sections.
