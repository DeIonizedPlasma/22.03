# Week 5

<div></div>

## Overview

<div></div>

We only had one class this week. The energy collector team made plans for our first prototype, which I will be working on next week. We didn't focus much on lens-based focusing but we talked a lot about mirrors and found some good approaches. While there are a number of documented projects using tesselated plates to approximate parabolas (see <a href="https://www.instructables.com/How-to-build-a-strikeheliostatstrike-paraboli/">here</a> or <a href="https://youtu.be/BtxdYgkcGtc">here</a>), it seemed much faster and easy to make one using a continuously deformed elastic sheet as in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CLRTa_ocmo">this video</a>.


The basic idea is to use a vacuum to deform a sheet of highly reflective material (mylar) into an approximate parabola (the physics for a membrane with a circular constraint actually predict a spherical shape), allowing for a perfectly smooth single surface. This bypasses the risks of tesselations or similar methods where seams between joined plates or layers of the membrane might lower efficiency; in pressure based designs, the mirror is monolithic. An example of the procedure we will be trying is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CLRTa_ocmo">here</a>, although we want to use a vacuum instead of pressure. A picture of the result from a vacuum-formed mirror is shown below alongside a tesselated mirror to compare how much more "ideal" pressure formed reflectors appear, optically speaking:

Next week we will be making the first vacuum prototype and likely planning our evaluation metrics so that we can start comparing different approaches.
