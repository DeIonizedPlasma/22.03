# Week 5

<div></div>

## Overview

<div></div>

We only had one class this week. The energy collector team made plans for our first prototype, which I will be working on next week. We didn't focus much on lens-based focusing but we talked a lot about mirrors and found some good approaches. While there are a number of documented projects using tesselated plates to approximate parabolas (see <a href="https://www.instructables.com/How-to-build-a-strikeheliostatstrike-paraboli/">here</a> or <a href="https://youtu.be/BtxdYgkcGtc">here</a>), it seemed much faster and easy to make one using a continuously deformed elastic sheet as in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CLRTa_ocmo">this video</a>.
