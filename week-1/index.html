## Precedents

### Strandebeest

Strandebeest is an example of wind power for the artistic goal of dynamic, biomimetic sculptures that exist in nature.

### Little Sun

Little Sun is a project which attempts to maximize the convenience and user-friendliness of solar powered lights for reading, in areas where electrical grid access is difficult or impossible.

## Group ideas

Our group proposed a few ideas:
- A device meant for scooters/bikes that harvests energy from the rider

- A stress ball that stores energy to be expended towards stress relief in some way

- A device to harvest ambient noise in loud areas

- Stairs that harvest energy from pedestrians to power some sort of visual/auditory art response

## End of week discussion

At the end of the week, we talked more about ideas for harvesting energy and the feasibility of various approaches. We did not elaborate much on the scooter or stress ball ideas, and didn't think of specific uses for the noise harvesting device but talked a bit about the energy usage limitations of piezoelectric supplies.

Most of the work that I personally did was in checking the approximate power provided by the various forms of energy (solar, wind, rain). The ranking of power available in Boston based on data for rainfall and average solar generation per area came out to Solar > Wind > Rain, with about a factor of 100 times more energy between each. I assumed the scale of our project as being approximately 2 square meters for solar and wind numbers, and a 10 foot height for the rain energy collection. We would get roughly 1kW averaged during the day for solar, 25W from wind, and 100mW during rain. These put quite different limits on what we can do depending on the source of power; 1kW is enough to drive a pretty serious motor for a kinetic sculpture that will work in wind or loaded with snow, while 100mW is not even enough to charge a phone and would struggle to drive even a microcontroller (essentially limiting the project to LEDs or LoRa sensor stuff).
