## 22.03 Project Portfolio

### Project Overview

This semester, the entire class will focus on a single project for the full duration of the term. Instructors will act as both advisors and clients for the project.

We will start with ideation, then proceed with design and development with the goal of having a working prototype by the end of the semester.

There will likely need to be several teams, depending on the needs of our project idea. These teams may potentially include:

- Energy capture/distribution
- Mechanical design
- Material selection
- Project management

### Project Brief

Students are to design an intervention that captures energy from the environment and uses it to accomplish one or more of the following:

- As a didactic tool to demonstrate to the public some principles related to sustainability and renewable resources
- To accomplish a task normally accomplished with traditional forms of energy
- Capture and utilize the energy in a novel manner beneficial to humanity
